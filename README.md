# Dotfiles

Personal dotfiles and configuration setup.

This repository contains my system configuration files, including shell, editor, and tool settings.

## Structure

- `dotfiles.list` – list of dotfiles and locations to be symlinked
- `install.sh` – installation script that creates symlinks and backs up existing files
- Other folders contain the actual configuration files

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
